# Team Overload

Project OVERLOAD is a strength training fitness tracking terminal app where you can log your exercises and see how you progress. The point is to help you progressive overload, which is when you “gradually increase the weight, frequency, or number of repetitions in your strength training routine”, which is effective in building strength and muscle. 

Project OVERLOAD will help you achieve this by allowing you to input the exercise you are doing, enter the number of sets, then the number of repetitions and weight for each of those sets. Once all is inputted, you can confirm your log and it will save it for you. Furthermore, you will be able to view history of your exercise logs, and search for specific logs by date. This will allow you to see whether or not you are progressively overloading in your strength training.
