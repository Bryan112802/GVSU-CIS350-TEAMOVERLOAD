# Introduction

Our project aims to be a fitness tracker for weightlifting to help you track and progress in your lifts. You will be able to track your workouts by logging the exercise you did, how many sets and reps, and how much weight you did for each set. Once you complete a workout (this is all the exercises you did in one session), you will be able to see a summary of your workout in a nice and clean format. Furthermore, having a history of your previous workout will allow you to progressive overload which is the main reason for having such a project.

What is progressive overload? Progressive overload is gradually increasing the intensity or difficulty of workouts over time in order to build muscle and strength. In simpler terms, you want to do more weight than your previous session for all exercises as this is one of the most important things when it comes to building muscle and strength. Since this project involves logging each exercise each workout, you will be able to progressive overload as you know how much weight you did last time.

# Anticipated Technologies

* Github 
* PC/Laptops 
* IntelliJ

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)
Our first step in developing the project is to complete the underlying mechanisms of out tracker. Specifically creating a logging system with comparison capabilities. These capabilities will likely be the core of the concept as the tracker is centered around being able to add more and more or "overload" your workouts. Afterward, we'd likely set up a planning page/template that can be printed and displayed to the users liking.

# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

# Anticipated Problems

(Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)
* A key problem will be being able to create a system with long term memory meaning likely a document or cache storing information for each user. 
* Working with these files is something that will present it's own challenges within the comparison system. 
* Normal scheduling issues that come with any project as the semester develops.
* There will be hurdles the team struggles to overcome specifically with logic in the software as we are not experts by any means.
