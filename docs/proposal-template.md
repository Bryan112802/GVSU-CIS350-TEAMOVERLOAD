# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)

# Anticipated Technologies

(What technologies are needed to build this project)
Github, PC/Laptops, IntelliJ

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)
Our first step in developing the project is to complete the underlying mechanisms of out tracker. Specifically creating a logging system with comparison capabilities. These capabilities will likely be the core of the concept as the tracker is centered around being able to add more and more or "overload" your workouts. Afterward, we'd likely set up a planning page/template that can be printed and displayed to the users liking.

# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

# Anticipated Problems

(Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)
* A key problem will be being able to create a system with long term memory meaning likely a document or cache storing information for each user. 
* Working with these files is something that will present it's own challenges within the comparison system. 
* Normal scheduling issues that come with any project as the semester develops.
* There will be hurdles the team struggles to overcome specifically with logic in the software as we are not experts by any means.
